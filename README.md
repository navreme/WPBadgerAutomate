#WPBadgerAutomate#

##Overview##

[TODO - be more specific]

WPBadgerAutomate is a WordPress plugin that extends WPBadger plugin https://github.com/davelester/WPBadger . It creates "autoawards" - processes that automaticaly issue badges based on preconfigured criteria.
Current version is going to provide following features:
* issue selected badge after registration
* issue selected badge based on accessing configurable unique URL
* issue selected badge based on earning some other badge/s (hierarchization)
And also:
* page with the overview of autoawards (with respect to its "visibility"; some could be secret;)

##Installation##

[TODO - as usual]

##Instructions for Using WPBadgerAutomate##

[TODO - be more specific; synch texts]

* Add Badges using WPBadger plugin as usual.
* Click the "Autoawards" link in menu and Add a new autoaward. Select type (after registration, based on URL, hierarchy)
* select Badge to be awarded automatically
* based on a type, set other required parameters (e.g. URL, select prerequisit badge/s)
* set Visibility (what should be publically available to users - from requirements super-secret to known)
* set limits for availability based on date (from-to) 
* Submit

Thats it! The whole process of awarding of badge follows the process model of WPBadger, therefore emails are being sent and has to be approved...
